"Notes","1. Mortality rates per 100,000 population standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population. Age-standardised rates are used for comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages. 
2. Figures are for deaths occurring rather than deaths registered each year.
3. Figures exclude deaths of non-residents.
4. Rates for the four warmest months have been annualised to be comparable with the annual rates."
